# welcome to my mc server ðŸ‘‹

<ins>*ill list quick info on this website, pls read through this at least once lol*</ins>

check [here](https://map.diffusehyperion.me) for an online map of the server!

the server's difficulty is hard mode at the moment

the server usually shutsdown at 11.30pm, and opens at 10am on weekends and 6.45am on weekdays

# UPDATE (March 27th):

copy pasting this announcement from discord to here

1st, i haven't talked with my dad about the electricity costs, but now that i think about it 24/7 uptime is a bit useless, so the server will be open during "reasonable" times IF THE DONATION THING HAPPENS

2nd, to make this crystal clear about what is breaking the rules: you are NOT allowed to join the server with any mods or texture packs that IS ABLE to provide a significant and unfair advantage compared to a vanilla installation.
  - this means you are not allowed to join with wrust, meteor, impact, whatever cheat mods there are
  - i dont really have a concrete term for significant, but if it gives a combat, movement or resource gathering advantage, it probably isnt allowed, but pls ask me to verify 
    - fullbright IS ALLOWED, but you are NOT ALLOWED to install a cheat mod "just for fullbright"
    - baritone is NOT ALLOWED at the moment, but hopefully it will be in the future 
- if you are able to provide video evidence of someone cheating IN GAME, i will immediately ban him, but if you can give enough proof that someone is doing something sus (such as someone moving really fast on dynmap), i will investigate further myself

3rd, difficulty was recently set to hard mode

4th, i will "soon" set up an auto shutdown of the server, stop sleeping at 12pm lol

5th, i do have a inventory rollback plugin, i will help you rollback if ONLY:
  - you are able to CLIP or show sufficient proof that you died BY NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN
    - if you could not do anything to alter or prevent your death, it is probably acceptable
  - rollbacks are on a case by case basis, pls dont spam ping me, if i know about it ill say it
